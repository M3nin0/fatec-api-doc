## Getting Started

A quick example will show how to use it, scrapping the user name. And will cover the usage with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) using ES6 syntax.

```js
const fatecApi = require('fatec-api')
const myAccount = new fatecApi.Account('LOGIN', 'PASSWORD')

myAccount.login().then(() => {
  return myAccount.getName().then(name => {
    console.log(name)
    // <- 'YOUR FULL NAME WITH CAPSLOCK'
  })
})
```

The scrapped data is available at `Account.student`, **continuing the example**: 

```js
myAccount.student.getName()
// <- 'YOUR FULL NAME WITH CAPSLOCK'
```

## How it works (Account.getName)

This library scrap data using HTTP requests with `request` and parses the HTML with `cheerio` library.

The [Account](/methods.md) class does the heavy lifting. Here's the flow of Account.getName():

The scrapped data is later available at [Account.student](/methods/student.md) on an account instance.
